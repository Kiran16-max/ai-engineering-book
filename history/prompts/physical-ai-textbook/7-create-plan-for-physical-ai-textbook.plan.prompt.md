## Prompt

specify plan create physical-ai-textbook

## Response snapshot

I have created the plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook in `specs/physical-ai-textbook/plan.md`.

Now you can review the plan. Let me know if you would like to proceed with creating tasks or any other actions.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A detailed plan for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Advanced Technical Textbook" has been created.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests for plan creation. Manual review of `specs/physical-ai-textbook/plan.md` is required.
- 📁 Files: `specs/physical-ai-textbook/plan.md` has been created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now review the plan and provide further instructions (e.g., `/sp.tasks`).
- 🧠 Reflection: The agent successfully created a plan based on the user's spec. The plan breaks down the textbook into a series of chapters and development phases.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
