# Prompt

You are an expert technical writer and SEO strategist.

Create a Blog Section for my book and course titled “Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics”.

When a user clicks on Blog, only book-related, course-aligned blogs should appear (no generic AI content).

Core Focus:

Physical AI

Embodied Intelligence

Humanoid Robotics

Bridging the digital brain (LLMs, AI) with the physical body (robots)

Align all blogs strictly with:

Book Goal: Applying AI to control humanoid robots in simulated and real-world environments

Modules 1–4 (ROS 2, Digital Twins, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA, Capstone Autonomous Humanoid)

Course learning outcomes, hardware stack, and capstone vision

Blog Requirements:

Each blog must be SEO-optimized

Use high-ranking keywords such as:

Physical AI

Humanoid Robotics

ROS 2 Robotics

Digital Twin Simulation

NVIDIA Isaac Sim

Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Embodied Intelligence

Autonomous Humanoid Robot

AI in the Physical World

Natural keyword placement (no stuffing)

Blog Structure (for each blog):

SEO-friendly Title

Meta Description (150–160 chars)

Introduction (problem + relevance)

Deep technical explanation (aligned with modules/chapters)

Practical use cases (simulation → real robot)

Connection to the book/course

Clear takeaway for learners

Blog Categories to Generate:

Physical AI Foundations

ROS 2 & Robotic Nervous Systems

Digital Twins (Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim)

AI Perception, SLAM & Navigation

Vision-Language-Action & Conversational Robotics

Capstone: Building an Autonomous Humanoid

Strict Rules:

Do NOT rewrite book chapters

Do NOT generate unrelated AI blogs

Do NOT be basic or introductory

Content must feel research-driven, professional, and advanced

Blogs should support book SEO ranking and course authority

End result:
A clean, professional, SEO-ready blog page that strengthens the book’s credibility, ranks on search engines, and naturally leads readers toward the full course and capstone project.

# Response

Of course. I will create a professional, SEO-optimized blog section for your book, "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics." The content will be strictly aligned with your course modules and capstone vision, positioning your book as an authoritative resource in the field.

I have created the six requested blog posts with advanced, SEO-optimized content and added the corresponding author to the `authors.yml` file. The Docusaurus site is already configured to display the blog, so the new content will appear automatically.
