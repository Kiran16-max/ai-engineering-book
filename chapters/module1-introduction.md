## Introduction

Module 1, "Foundations of Physical AI," establishes the critical bedrock for understanding and interacting with intelligent robotic systems. This Module is designed to immerse you in the core communication frameworks and robotic description languages that underpin advanced physical AI applications. From understanding fundamental concepts like the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) to precisely defining robotic kinematics with URDF, you will gain the essential technical literacy required to program, control, and simulate humanoid robots effectively.

This foundational knowledge is indispensable for any endeavor in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, enabling you to design robust and scalable robotic behaviors. It provides the necessary tools to interpret sensor data, send commands, and model complex robotic systems, serving as the gateway to developing truly autonomous and adaptive agents.

### Module 1 - Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

This Chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, the next-generation Robot Operating System. You will learn about its architecture, design principles, and how it facilitates distributed robotics development, setting the stage for building interconnected robotic components.

### Module 1 - Chapter 2: Nodes, Topics, and Services

Delve deeper into the core communication mechanisms of ROS 2. This Chapter explains the roles of nodes, topics, and services, demonstrating how they enable modularity and efficient data exchange within a robotic system. You will learn to establish communication pipelines for complex behaviors.

### Module 1 - Chapter 3: rclpy and Python Agents

Focus on `rclpy`, the Python client library for ROS 2. This Chapter guides you through developing robotic agents using Python, covering message definitions, publishers, subscribers, and service clients/servers, empowering you to create custom control logic.

### Module 1 - Chapter 4: URDF for Humanoid Robots

Learn to describe the kinematic and dynamic properties of humanoid robots using the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF). This Chapter covers creating, parsing, and visualizing URDF models, essential for accurate simulation and precise motion planning in complex robotic systems.
