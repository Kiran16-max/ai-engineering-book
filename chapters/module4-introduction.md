## Introduction to Vision-Language-Action Models

Welcome to the final module of our book, "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics." In this module, we will explore the exciting and rapidly evolving field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.

VLA models represent a significant leap forward in the quest for creating truly intelligent and autonomous robots. By integrating the power of large language models (LLMs) with computer vision and robotic control, VLA models enable robots to understand and interact with the world in a much more human-like way.

Throughout this module, you will learn how to:
- Bridge the gap between LLMs and robotics.
- Implement voice-to-action systems using state-of-the-art speech recognition.
- Develop cognitive planning capabilities for your robots.
- Build a complete autonomous humanoid robot in our capstone project.

This module will bring together all the concepts and skills you have learned in the previous modules, and provide you with a solid foundation for building the next generation of intelligent robots.
