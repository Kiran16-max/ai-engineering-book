---

## Introduction

This Module delves into the creation and utilization of digital twins for humanoid robotics, focusing on two powerful simulation platforms: Gazebo and Unity. Digital twins serve as virtual counterparts to physical systems, enabling safe and efficient development, testing, and deployment of complex AI behaviors for robots.

We will explore the fundamental aspects of building realistic and interactive simulated environments, from configuring physics and gravity to integrating high-fidelity rendering and simulating diverse sensor modalities. Understanding these concepts is crucial for bridging the gap between theoretical AI models and their practical application in the physical world.
