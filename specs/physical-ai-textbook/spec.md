# Feature Specification: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Advanced Technical Textbook

## 1. Goal

Create a complete, advanced, industry-ready textbook for students, teachers, researchers, job holders, and robotics/AI professionals who want to learn Physical AI, Digital Twins, and Humanoid Robotics using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## 2. Audience

- Undergraduate & graduate AI/CS students
- Robotics teachers and instructors
- Researchers & engineers
- Industry professionals transitioning into robotics
- Entrepreneurs building robotics startups

## 3. Quarter Overview

The book explains how AI moves from digital spaces into the physical world. Students will learn to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac. The book provides end-to-end training for Physical AI systems, Digital Twins, humanoid locomotion, and Vision-Language-Action models.
