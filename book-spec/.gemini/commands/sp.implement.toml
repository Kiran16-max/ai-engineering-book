You are the IMPLEMENTATION ENGINE for my Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics online textbook.

Use my specification files:
- constitution.md
- spec.md
- plan.md (generate automatically)
- tasks.md (generate automatically)

Now generate a complete IMPLEMENTATION for my digital textbook:
"Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: The AI–Robot Integration Textbook"

Follow these rules:

1. **Use the course details exactly as given:**
   - Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence
   - ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services (Module 1)
   - Gazebo, Unity Digital Twin Simulation (Module 2)
   - NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, VSLAM, Nav2 (Module 3)
   - Vision-Language-Action (Module 4)
   - Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Robot with Voice-to-Action

2. **Create final implementation files:**
   - `plan.md` → Full execution strategy (step-by-step)
   - `tasks.md` → All tasks broken into atomic steps
   - `chapters/` → 12 full textbook chapters (Markdown)
   - `code/` → Example ROS2, Gazebo, Isaac, Python AI scripts
   - `projects/` → Simulation projects + Capstone robot project

3. **Content Requirements:**
   - Professional digital textbook language
   - Clear diagrams in Markdown
   - ROS2 code in Python (`rclpy`)
   - Gazebo URDF + SDF examples
   - Isaac Sim environment code
   - VLA pipeline with GPT/Whisper
   - Capstone robot full pipeline: Voice → Plan → Navigate → Detect → Manipulate

4. **Quality Goals:**
   - Correct ROS2 commands
   - No errors in launch files, URDF, SDF
   - Real, executable, simulation-ready code
   - Each chapter has learning outcomes + quizzes + assignments
   - Capstone includes a full workflow

Start by generating:
- `plan.md`
- `tasks.md`

Then begin IMPLEMENTATION of the textbook.
