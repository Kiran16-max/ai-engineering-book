description = """
Based on the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course content, generate a structured list of actionable development tasks for the textbook. Include tasks for:
1. Writing each module (ROS 2, Gazebo & Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, Vision-Language-Action).
2. Weekly breakdown implementation.
3. Creating diagrams, simulation examples, and code snippets.
4. Hardware lab setup instructions.
5. Capstone project step-by-step guidance.
6. Assessments (projects, simulations, pipelines).
7. Research references (APA style, minimum 15 sources).
8. Validation tasks for accuracy and technical correctness.

Each task should include:
- Task Name
- Description
- Dependencies (if any)
- Estimated Completion (in hours or days)
- Priority (High, Medium, Low)
- Responsible Section (e.g., Module 1, Module 2...)

Output should be in Markdown format, ready to save as `tasks.md`.
