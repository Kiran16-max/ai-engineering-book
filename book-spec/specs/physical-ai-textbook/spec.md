# Feature Specification: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Advanced Technical Textbook

## 1. Introduction
This specification outlines the creation of an advanced technical textbook for students, teachers, researchers, and professionals to learn Physical AI, Digital Twins, and Humanoid Robotics using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## 2. Goal
Create a complete, advanced, industry-ready textbook that enables readers to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots and understand Physical AI systems end-to-end.

## 3. Audience
- Undergraduate & graduate AI/CS students
- Robotics teachers and instructors
- Researchers & engineers
- Industry professionals transitioning into robotics
- Entrepreneurs building robotics startups

## 4. Quarter Overview
The textbook explains how AI moves from digital spaces into the physical world. Students will learn to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac. The book provides end-to-end training for Physical AI systems, Digital Twins, humanoid locomotion, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.

## 5. Modules
